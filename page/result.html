                    India's economy tanked from April to June by a whopping 23.9 percent, recording the steepest contraction among the world's G20 countries, reflecting years of uneven development and the country's fragile economic structure that melted down instantly under the impact of the COVID-19 onslaught.
                    Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi is facing mounting pressure as the current fiscal year is expected to see a drastic GDP contraction of at least 10 percent, as estimated by the economists based in India and abroad. Tens of millions of Indians are expected to return to poverty.
